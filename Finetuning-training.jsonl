The veins (blue) take oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. 1  Arteries begin with the aorta, the large artery leaving the heart. 2  They carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to all of the body's tissues. 3  They branch several times, becoming smaller and smaller as they carry blood further from the heart. 1 These are blood vessels that take oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. 2  Veins become larger and larger as they get closer to the heart. 3  The superior vena cava is the large vein that brings blood from the head and arms to the heart, and the inferior vena cava brings blood from the abdomen and legs in\n\nPassage5\nLocation: The coronary system is comprised of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins. From the innumerable cardiac capillaries, blood flows back to the cardiac chambers through venules, which in turn coalesce into the cardiac veins. \n\nPassage6\nIn the circulatory system, veins (from the Latin vena) are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart. Veins are less muscular than arteries and are often closer to the skin. There are valves in most veins to prevent backflow.\n\nPassage7\nThe heart is a pumping system which takes in deoxygenated blood through the veins and delivers it to the lungs for oxygenation before pumping it into the various arteries (which provide oxygen and nutrients to body tissues by transporting the blood throughout the body). The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic veins and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it through the systemic arteries to the tissues of the body.\n\nPassage8\nOverview. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood from your body's tissues to your heart. Your heart pumps the blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then is pumped to your body through blood vessels called arteries. \n\nPassage9\nThe pulmonary veins carry relatively oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The superior and inferior venae cavae carry relatively deoxygenated blood from the upper and lower systemic circulations, respectively. The portal venous system is a series of veins or venules that directly connect two capillary beds. In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart.

The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the diode's forward direction), while blocking current in the opposite direction (the reverse direction). Thus, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a check valve.\n\nPassage2\nA semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p\u2013n junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the diode's forward direction), while blocking current in the opposite direction (the reverse direction). Thus, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a check valve.\n\nPassage3\nA diode placed in series with the positive side of the power supply is called a reverse protection diode. It ensures that current can only flow in the positive direction, and the power supply only applies a positive voltage to your circuit. \n\nPassage4\nA diode is a specialized electronic component with two electrodes called the anode and the cathode. Most diodes are made with semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium, or selenium. \n\nPassage5\nOperation of Zener Diode: 1  Zener diodes are normally used only in the reverse bias direction. 2  It means that the anode must be connected to the negative side of the voltage source and the cathode must be connected to the positive side. 1 Varying amount of reverse current can pass through the diode without damaging it. 2  The breakdown voltage or zener voltage (VZ) across the diode remains relatively constant. 3  The maximum reverse current is limited, however, by the wattage rating of the diode.\n\nPassage6\nIn this interactive and animated object, learners examine the operation of a semiconductor diode when it is forward and reverse biased. \n\nPassage7\nVaractor diodes or varicap diodes are semiconductor devices that are widely used in the electronics industry and are used in many applications where a voltage controlled variable capacitance is required. \n\nPassage8\nA PIN diode is a diode with a wide, undoped intrinsic semiconductor region between a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor region. The p-type and n-type regions are typically heavily doped because they are used for ohmic contacts. The wide intrinsic region is in contrast to an ordinary PN diode. A PIN diode operates under what is known as high-level injection. In other words, the intrinsic i region is flooded with charge carriers from the p and n regions. Its function can be likened to filling up a water bucket with a hole on the side. Once the water reaches the hole's level it will begin to pour out.\n\nPassage9\nZener diodes have many of the same basic properties of ordinary semiconductor diodes. They conduct in the forward direction and have the same turn on voltage as ordinary diodes. For silicon this is about 0.6 volts. In the reverse direction, the operation of a Zener diode is quite different to an ordinary diode. For low voltages the diodes do not conduct as would be expected. However, once a certain voltage is reached the diode breaks down and current flows.

There is also QPSK, which is a format used for satellite broadcasting \u2013 but since those are received by proprietary satellite TV boxes, not HDTV tuners and TVs, it\u2019s not important for this discussion.\n\nPassage6\nAn ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) tuner, often called an ATSC receiver or HDTV tuner is a type of television tuner that allows reception of digital television (DTV) television channels transmitted by television stations in North America, parts of Central America and South Korea that use ATSC standards. When the ATSC tuner does a channel scan, it finds the signal on channel 43, learns that this material is called Channel 4, and remembers that mapping. The user can tune to 4, and the tuner will know to tune in 43.\n\nPassage7\nIn this video I'll show you how to receive FREE HD channels using an antenna and an ATSC digital tuner. Of course you will also need an HDTV. The simplest and most cost effective thing to do is get a TV that has an ATSC tuner built in. Then all you need is an antenna. \n\nPassage8\nNTSC-This is your analog TV tuner that is built into every VCR and Television in America. Basically its purpose is to bring in ANALOG broadcasts. Will receive Cable or Antenna Broadcasts. It will be in every TV that you buy. ATSC-This is the Hight Definition Tuner that by this time next year is required to be in every new television 20 and larger. Its purpose is to receive OVER THE AIR (OTA) broadcasts from local channels via an Antenna, not cable. QAM-is a High Definition Cable tuner. Used to receive HD Cable broadcasts without a box, just connect your coax directly to the Television.\n\nPassage9\nATSC is the standard for over-the-air broadcasts of digital TV stations. You can buy ATSC antennas and ATSC tuners that will enable you to receive digital stations over the air. You can use HDTV's to display digital stations, or buy an ATSC converter box to use an older television. Check out NAB Station List to find what RF channels are used by the tv stations in your area.

Passage 9 directly addresses the query about what an ATSC antenna is by mentioning that \"You can buy ATSC antennas and ATSC tuners that will enable you to receive digital stations over the air.\" Therefore, it ranks highest as it most directly answers the query.\n\nThe remaining passages, while relevant, discuss ATSC from different angles without focusing specifically on ATSC antennas. For example, Passage 5 touches on ATSC channels and indirectly refers to the reception of broadcasts which could involve an antenna but is more focused on the technical specifications of the signal. Passages 1, 2, 4, and 6 describe ATSC tuners and their function, offering context but not directly answering the query about antennas. Passage 3 and Passage 7 provide general information on ATSC standards and the setup for receiving HD channels, respectively.

An avalanche is a mass of snow, often mixed with ice and debris which travels down mountain sides, destroying all in its path. \n\nPassage4\nAn avalanche of snow sweeps down the slopes of Mount Timpanogos in Utah. Greg L. Wright. An avalanche is a large amount of snow that quickly moves down a slope. An avalanche can be deadly because it will bury or sweep away anything in its path. Large amounts of sliding rocks, earth, or other materials may also be called avalanches. But these are often known as landslides. \n\nPassage5\nSeismic activity may also trigger the failure in the snowpack and avalanches. A popular myth is that avalanches can be triggered by loud noise or shouting, but the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. Slides of rocks or debris, behaving in a similar way to snow, are also referred to as avalanches (see rockslide)\n\nPassage6\nAn avalanche has three main parts. The starting zone is the most volatile area of a slope, where unstable snow can fracture from the surrounding snow cover and begin to slide. Typical starting zones are higher up on slopes. However, given the right conditions, snow can fracture at any point on the slope. Snow Avalanches. Avalanches can be caused by a variety of factors, including terrain, slope steepness, weather, temperature, and snowpack conditions.

Although avalanches can occur on any slope given the right conditions, certain times of the year and certain locations are naturally more dangerous than others\n\nPassage7\nThere are two common types of avalanches, a Surface Avalanche that occurs when a layer of snow with different properties slides over another layer of snow. For example, when a layer of dry loosely packed snow slides over a dense layer of wet snow. The other common avalanche is known as a Full-Depth Avalanche which, as it s name would lead you to believe, occurs when an entire snow cover, from the earth to the surface, slides over the ground. An avalanche can be composed of many different kinds of snow depending on the region, temperature and weather.\n\nPassage8\nTechnically, an avalanche is any amount of snow sliding down a mountainside.

The auroras generally occur along the auroral ovals, which center on the magnetic poles (not the geographic poles) and roughly correspond with the Arctic and Antarctic circles. There are times, though, when the lights are farther south, usually when there are a lot of sunspots.\n\nPassage6\nThe lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres.

September, October, March and April are some of the best months to view the aurora borealis. Where to see the lights. The best places to see the northern lights are Alaska and northern Canada, but visiting these vast, open expanses is not always easy. Norway, Sweden and Finland also offer excellent vantage points.\n\nPassage9\nThe Northern Lights, as the name suggests, are especially related to the polar regions. They occur most frequently in a belt of radius 2500 km centered on the magnetic north pole. In Troms and Finnmark, we can see the Northern Lights every other clear night, if not even more frequently.

It is used clinically to raise blood pressure, in the case of shock, to treat depression, and to t \u2026 reat certain dopamine deficiency states like Parkinson's disease. Dopamine is a Neurotransmitter as well as a Neurohormone. Its secretion is linked to increased heart rate and blood pressure. As released by the hypothalamus, it acts as an inhibitory hormone which stops the anterior pituitary gland from releasing prolactin\n\nPassage2\nSHARE. Dopamine is a famous chemical. It holds a prized position in the annals of popular science as the \u201creward\u201d drug. Countless articles refer to the latest studies of foods, sex and exercise as boosting dopamine, and, by implication, pleasure. But is this characterization correct? What does dopamine actually do? A key finding is that dopamine is not the \u201creward\u201d chemical, at least not in the way that the media would have us believe. In the 1990s, a now-classic experiment was carried out by Wolfram Schultz and colleagues. He recorded from brain cells that produce dopamine and deliver it to other brain areas.\n\nPassage3\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that is produced by the brains of many organisms, including humans. Like many neurotransmitters, it has several different functions. It plays a critical role in the function of the central nervous system, and it is also linked with the brain 's complex system of motivation and reward. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is produced in several areas of the brain. Dopamine levels increase when stimulated by certain drugs such as nicotine. Exercise can increase a person's dopamine levels. Low dopamine levels may cause weight gain.\n\nPassage4\nL-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does reach the brain and is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's disease. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and the hormone epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), with O 2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors.\n\nPassage5\nIn the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter \u2014a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior. Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and the hormone epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), with O 2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors.\n\nPassage6\nAn increase in the firing of these neurons is a sign that more dopamine is being released in the brain. Schultz switched on a light, and then delivered a tasty drop of juice to the animal. Initially, the dopamine cells responded to the juice, consistent with the \u201creward\u201d theory. A key finding is that dopamine is not the \u201creward\u201d chemical, at least not in the way that the media would have us believe. In the 1990s, a now-classic experiment was carried out by Wolfram Schultz and colleagues. He recorded from brain cells that produce dopamine and deliver it to other brain areas.\n\nPassage7\nDopamine is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the human brain and body, as well as elsewhere in biology. Its name derives from its chemical structure: it is an amine formed by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of L-DOPA. Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and the hormone epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), with O 2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors.\n\nPassage8\nConfidence votes 360.

Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can result in hypothyroidism in women. While iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones, the selenium-containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) are enzymes (or selenoenzymes) required for the conversion of T 4 to the biologically active thyroid hormone, T 3 (see the article on Selenium).\n\nPassage2\n1 Iodine is a key component of thyroid hormones, which are required throughout life for normal growth, neurological development, and metabolism. ( 2 More information). 3  Insufficient iodine intake impairs the production of thyroid hormones, leading to a condition called hypothyroidism. While iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones, the selenium-containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) are enzymes (or selenoenzymes) required for the conversion of T 4 to the biologically active thyroid hormone, T 3 (see the article on Selenium).\n\nPassage3\nGoiter is the term that means enlargement of the thyroid gland. Iodine deficient goiter results because iodine is a crucial component of active thyroid hormones. If there is a low level of iodine in the diet, then less active T3 and T4 can be synthesized. \n\nPassage4\nThe thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland. When the thyroid is influenced by mercury, there is a high incidence of unexplained depression and anxiety. A person may have adequate levels of T3 and T4 hormones, but if the hormones are contaminated, the person is functionally thyroid deficient. Myxedema is the reaction in adulthood to lack of thyroid hormone, either because the thyroid gland wastes away or has to be removed, or because of failure of the pituitary gland to stimulate thyroid activity. Myxedema brings with it gradual personality changes along with marked physical changes.\n\nPassage5\nThe pituitary gland sends signals to other glands, for example the thyroid gland, to produce hormones, such as thyroid hormone. The hormones produced by the pituitary gland and other glands have a significant impact on bodily functions, such as growth, reproduction, blood pressure, and metabolism. Tumors can cause damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus and can therefore result in a loss of function. Damage to the pituitary gland can also be caused by radiation, surgery, infections such as meningitis, or various other conditions. In some cases, the cause is unknown.\n\nPassage6\nIodine is a trace element that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). When iodide enters the circulation, the thyroid gland concentrates it in appropriate amounts for thyroid hormone synthesis and most of the remaining amount is excreted in the urine [ 2 ]. The iodine-replete healthy adult has about 15\u201320 mg of iodine, 70%\u201380% of which is contained in the thyroid [ 6 ].\n\nPassage7\nThe thyroid is controlled by the pituitary gland, which secretes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in response to the amount of thyroxin it finds in the blood. TSH increases the amount of thyroxin secreted by the thyroid and also causes the thyroid gland to grow. \n\nPassage8\nNormally, TSH increases the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland and increases production of thyroid hormone. If there is little iodine available in our diet, insufficient thyroid hormone is produced by the thyroid; hypothalamic TRH causes TSH to be released from the pituitary in large amounts. Thyroid Disease... The thyroid gland is located in the front of the neck attached to the lower part of the voicebox (or larynx) and to the upper part of the windpipe (or trachea). It has two sides or lobes. These lobes are connected by a narrow neck (or isthmus).

It directly addresses the process involving the pituitary gland's response to iodine deficiency, illustrating how low dietary iodine triggers the hypothalamus to release TRH, which in turn causes the release of TSH from the pituitary in large amounts to compensate. This explanation provides the most direct answer to the query asked.\n\nSubsequently, passages related to the thyroid gland's iodine dependency, its overall functions, and control by the pituitary gland are ranked, even if they don't directly mention the effect of iodine deficiency on the pituitary gland. Passage 7 follows due to its discussion on how the pituitary gland controls the thyroid gland through TSH, touching on the regulatory mechanism relevant to iodine deficiency indirectly. Passage 1 presents details on iodine's importance during pregnancy and gives a broader context of iodine's role in thyroid health. Passage 2 and passage 6 likewise offer foundation knowledge on iodine's significance and function, making them pertinent though less directly answering the query. Passages 3, 5, and 4 talk broadly about thyroid health and issues without directly linking to the pituitary gland's response to iodine deficiency, placing them lower in the ranking due to their indirect relevance.\n\nFinal Ranking: (8,7,1,2,6,3,5,4)"}]}

The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occurs when the heart beats. There are two phases of the cardiac cycle. In the diastole phase, the heart ventricles are relaxed and the heart fills with blood. In the systole phase, the ventricles contract and pump blood to the arteries. One cardiac cycle is completed when the heart fills with blood and the blood is pumped out of the heart.\n\nPassage2\nThe cardiac cycle consists of a systole and a diastole. The cardiac cycle begins with a joint diastole (relaxation of all four chambers of the heart). This is followed by an arterial systole (contraction of left and right atria) stimulated by the generation of an action potential by the Sino-Auricular Node (SA node). This is followed by closing of the AV valves which produces the sound 'lubb' and the closure of the Semilunar valves causes produces the sound 'dub'. How your heart works-Know your cardiac cycle and blood flow in heart.\n\nPassage3\nThe cardiac cycle refers to a complete heartbeat from its generation to the beginning of the next beat, and so includes the diastole, the systole, and the intervening pause. The frequency of the cardiac cycle is described by the heart rate, which is typically expressed as beats per minute. Each beat of the heart involves five major stages. The first two stages, often considered together as the ventricular filling stage, involve the movement of blood from the atria into the ventricles. Ventricular diastole is when the ventricles are relaxing, while atrial diastole is when the atria are relaxing. Together they are known as complete cardiac diastole. During ventricular diastole, the pressure in the (left and right) ventricles drops from the peak that it reaches in systole.\n\nPassage4\n3.

Cardiac cycle is the term used to describe the relaxation and contraction that occur, as a heart works to pump blood through the body. Heart rate is a term used to describe the frequency of the cardiac cycle. It is considered one of the four vital signs. The heart in the diastole phase. Cardiac Diastole is the period of time when the heart relaxes after contraction in preparation for refilling with circulating blood. Ventricular diastole is when the ventricles are relaxing, while atrial diastole is when the atria are relaxing.\n\nPassage6\nOne cardiac cycle consists of the atria and then the ventricles contracting so that the blood that has entered the heart is pumped out. This occurs about 70 times every minute and is continuous. The periods of contraction are called systole. The periods of relaxation are called diastole. The ventricles relax-ventricular diastole-and the semilunar valves snap shut behind the blood (the second heart sound). To work out from a graph what stage of the cycle the heart is in, it is important to look at the relative pressure of the atria and ventricles.\n\nPassage7\nIn this lesson, you will learn what happens during each heartbeat, or cardiac cycle. You will also learn that the heartbeat involves periods of relaxation and contraction, known as diastole and systole, respectively. Lesson Summary.

The weighted average method is used to assign the average cost of production to a product. Weighted average costing is commonly used in situations where: 1  Inventory items are so intermingled that it is impossible to assign a specific cost to an individual unit. 2  The accounting system is not sufficiently sophisticated to track FIFO or LIFO inventory layers.\n\nPassage2\nThe main difference between weighted average cost accounting, LIFO, and FIFO methods of accounting is the difference in which each method calculates inventory and cost of goods sold. The weighted average cost method uses the average of the costs of the goods to assign costs. In other words, weighted average uses the formula: Total cost of items in inventory available for sale divided by total number of units available for sale. In contrast, FIFO (first in, first out) accounting means that the costs assigned to goods are the costs for the first goods bought. \n\nPassage3\nInstead, the weighted average method of costing inventory assigns an average cost to each piece of inventory when it is sold. When unit of inventory is sold, the weighted average method of costing inventory takes the average cost of all inventories currently available. This average price is then assigned to the item sold. Since inventory prices fluctuate, the weighted average cost will also change. Think about it this way.\n\nPassage4\nWhen using the weighted average method, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale, which yields the weighted-average cost per unit. In this calculation, the cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and net purchases. You then use this weighted-average figure to assign a cost to both ending inventory and the cost of goods sold. The net result of using weighted average costing is that the recorded amount of inventory on hand represents a value somewhere between the oldest and newest units purchased into stock. Weighted average costing is commonly used in situations where: 1  Inventory items are so intermingled that it is impossible to assign a specific cost to an individual unit. 2  The accounting system is not sufficiently sophisticated to track FIFO or LIFO inventory layers.\n\nPassage5\nThe weighted average method is an inventory costing method that assigns average costs to each piece of inventory when it is sold during the year. Retailers and other businesses that keep and sell inventory must keep track of the cost of inventory on hand as well as the cost of inventory that was sold. When unit of inventory is sold, the weighted average method of costing inventory takes the average cost of all inventories currently available. This average price is then assigned to the item sold. Since inventory prices fluctuate, the weighted average cost will also change. Think about it this way.\n\nPassage6\nAverage costing method in periodic inventory system: When average costing method is used in a periodic inventory system, the cost of goods sold and the cost of ending inventory is computed using weighted average unit cost. Weighted average unit cost is computed using the following formula : Average costing method in perpetual inventory system: When average costing method is used in a perpetual inventory system, an average unit cost figure is computed each time a purchase is made. This average unit cost figure is then used to assign cost to each unit sold until a new\n\nPassage7\nAverage Cost (AVCO) Method. Average cost method (AVCO) calculates the cost of ending inventory and cost of goods sold for a period on the basis of weighted average cost per unit of inventory. Weighted average cost per unit is calculated using the following formula: It is then multiplied with number of units sold and number of units in ending inventory to arrive at cost of goods sold and value of ending inventory respectively. In perpetual inventory system, we have to calculate the weighted average cost per unit before each sale transaction.\n\nPassage8\nLike FIFO and LIFO methods, AVCO is also applied differently in periodic inventory system and perpetual inventory system. In periodic inventory system, weighted average cost per unit is calculated for the entire class of inventory. It is then multiplied with number of units sold and number of units in ending inventory to arrive at cost of goods sold and value of ending inventory respectively. In perpetual inventory system, we have to calculate the weighted average cost per unit before each sale transaction.\n\nPassage9\nUnder the 'Average Cost Method', it is assumed that the cost of inventory is based on the average cost of the goods available for sale during the period. Weighted Average Cost is a method of calculating Ending Inventory cost. It is also known as WAVCOs. It takes Cost of Goods Available for Sale and divides it by the number of units available for sale (number of goods from Beginning Inventory + Purchases /production). This gives a Weighted Average Cost per Unit.

This equation simply means that carbon dioxide from the air and water combine in the presence of sunlight to form sugars; oxygen is released as a by-product of this reaction.\n\nPassage2\nCellular respiration is the set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although technically, cellular respiration is a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell due to slow release of energy from the series of reactions.\n\nPassage3\nGlucose (sugar) + Oxygen \u2192 Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP).

Regular cellular respiration is aerobic (requires oxygen), but some simple organisms can only do anaerobic cellular respiration.\n\nPassage4\nThe equation of cellular respiration helps in calculating the release of energy by breaking down glucose in the presence of oxygen in a cell. If you are searching for information on the formula of cellular respiration equation, the following Buzzle article will prove to be useful.

Look for primroses that are healthy in appearance, preferably with unopened buds. Primrose perennials should be planted in lightly shaded areas with well-drained soil, preferably amended with organic matter. Set primrose plants about 6 to 12 inches apart and 4 to 6 inches deep.\n\nPassage3\nPrimroses can be cultivated as annuals or perennials. Primroses (Primula spp.) are some of the earliest flowers to bloom. In fact, they often bloom when mornings are still dark and the ground is still frozen. As annuals, they can be grown in USDA zones 1 through 11, according to Washington State University Extension. Primroses are favorite container plants, and the fact that they are also an inexpensive plant makes choosing primroses for container gardens an easy choice for many home gardeners.\n\nPassage4\nHardy perennial. This completely new form of hose-in-hose primula has been produced here in the gardens at Plant World. The busy bees here have managed to cross our new hose-in-hose cowslip with an old fashioned polyanthus. \n\nPassage5\nPRIMULA: Primrose. Primroses have been a vibrant addition to the spring, woodland garden and containers for over a century. The name Primula is derived from the Italian word for spring primavera. An explosion of color in every shade of the rainbow, primroses primarily prefer cooler temperatures and therefore bloom early spring through May. Primroses combine fabulously with spring bulbs, evergreen grasses and dusty miller. P. vulgaris-English Primrose. These may be the most familiar primroses that are often used in winter bedding areas for their vibrant colors. Lately there has been more development with double types such as the Rosanna and Doublet series. Also, the \u2018Wanda\u2019 series has a darker leaf and the flowers are in rich jewel tones.\n\nPassage6\nHabitat. The primula is a hardy perennial alpine plant which can withstand cold conditions, but its ideal setting is woodland which contains soil that is rich in humus and remains moist throughout the year but is also well drained. Availability. The primula plant grows close to the ground and features a variety of different coloured flowers, including purple, red, white, yellow and variegated. The foliage around the flowers is usually described as being of a rosette shape and is often a very dark green.\n\nPassage7\nPrimrose. Primula. Take a walk down the primrose path and you'll never look back! Primroses are a classic cottage flower and are popular with collectors.

(Milkwood bark was traditionally used for broken bones-so the essence is helpful here-this essence is very much to do with underlying structure and form; stability and grounding.). The Milkwood Tree in Nature. Milkwoods are hardy, slow-growing trees with deep-green, leathery leaves and rough grayish-brown bark.\n\nPassage3\nSideroxylon inerme is a semi-coastal sturdy broadleaf evergreen tree with dense foliage, displays of white bisexual flowers and edible purplish-black berries. It boasts leathery, spiral leaves, which, like the berries, contain milky latex. The Milkwood has considerable value in traditional medicine and attracts birds, monkeys and other animals to its flowers and fruits: Speckled mousebirds eat the flowers; birds, bats, monkeys and bush pigs eat the fruit.\n\nPassage4\nThe energy of the milkwood tree brings a deep sense of connection and belonging. The energy of the milkwood tree can assist us with feeling at home on the Earth \u2013 it connects you with your personal power, and reminds you on the cellular level that we are all one family. This is a nurturing and supportive tree and the essence may balance feelings of insecurity and lack of grounding. May be useful for adjusting to changes in the family structure brought about through loss or divorce. Milkwood essence may be helpful for nightmares and fears of the unknown.\n\nPassage5\nThe tree\u2019s formal name means \u201cIron-wood\u201d in Greek, referring to its very hard timber. It is one of South Africa\u2019s \u201cProtected Trees\u201d and several specimens are provincial heritage sites. This is the only member of the Sideroxylon genus in Southern Africa. Young branches and new leaves are always covered with fine hairs. The tree can reach 15 m. The Milkwood has considerable value in traditional medicine and attracts birds, monkeys and other animals to its flowers and fruits: Speckled mousebirds eat the flowers; birds, bats, monkeys and bush pigs eat the fruit. It is also an effective firebreak and is cultivated for that purpose\n\nPassage6\nA characteristic feature of the Southern Overberg, the milkwood is a low-growing, evergreen tree. It is rarely found with a straight trunk; instead, its gnarled, sprawling branches often create impenetrable thickets that are home to a variety of wild life. The small, yellowy-green flowers have an unusual sour-smell (Jan-July). The edible, juicy, black fruit (July-Jan) are enjoyed by birds and baboons. The milky latex which gives the tree its common name makes the leaves and the bark unpalatable to grazing animals. The wood is very hard, heavy and strong. In the past, it was used for ship building, bridges, mills and ploughs. It is very durable even when wet and it shrinks little with drying\n\nPassage7\nStatus Sideroxylon inerme is widespread on mountains and is not an endangered species. It is, however, one of South Africa's Protected Trees, which means that no milkwood may be damaged, moved or felled. Derivation of the name Sideroxylon is a small genus found in Africa, America and Asia with one species in South Africa, Sideroxylon inerme. The tree has a sturdy trunk that is normally 600mm in diameter, and a large, dense, rounded crown. The bark is normally grey-brown to black. Young branches are always covered with fine hairs. The leaves are leathery and spirally arranged, dark green above and dull beneath.\n\nPassage8\nThe Sideroxylon inerme trees are scattered through the coastal woodlands and littoral forests of South Africa as far as Zimbabwe. Historically, dense forests of large Milkwood trees used to exist along the coast and bays of Cape Town, especially at Noordhoek, Macassar and Gordons Bay.

We get vitamins from food, because the human body either does not produce enough of them, or none at all. An organic compound contains carbon. When an organism (living thing) cannot produce enough of an organic chemical compound that it needs in tiny amounts, and has to get it from food, it is called a vitamin. \n\nPassage2\nIn humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, to the degree that urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. \n\nPassage3\nVitamin A: Why It's Important. Vitamin A is commonly known as the vitamin needed for good eyesight. Along with promoting vision, vitamin A is also vital for regulating genes, maintaining healthy skin, supporting the immune system and producing red blood cells. Vitamin A is also needed for the formation and activation of white blood cells. Vitamin A Is Important for Red Blood Cell Production. All blood cells are developed from stem cells. Vitamin A facilitates the specialization of stems into\n\nPassage4\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. Antioxidants are chemicals which may help reduce risk of cancer. Since vitamin A is fat-soluble it is not needed in daily, large quantities. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in organs such as the liver. Most of the vitamin A that we consume goes to the liver to be stored until it is needed by another part of the body. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is known as carotenoids. The most common type of carotenoid is-carotene (beta carotene). These carotenoids are used to build the type of vitamin A used by our body. Vitamin A is important to vision and the growth of the bones.\n\nPassage5\nVitamin D: Why It's Important. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in the human body. It has many functions, and a lack of vitamin D can lead to many health problems. Bone Growth. Vitamin D is essential in bone growth. Its main role in the body is to increase the flow of calcium into the bloodstream. Without vitamin D, calcium would not be absorbed into the body. Therefore, vitamin D is equally important to the maintenance of bone health as is calcium. Extreme deficiency of vitamin D during childhood results in a disease called rickets.\n\nPassage6\nVitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin, the light-absorbing molecule necessary for both low-light (scotopic vision) and color vision. 1 Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2  Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. 3  It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate.\n\nPassage7\nVitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient found in many foods. In the body, it acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are compounds formed when our bodies convert the food we eat into energy. \n\nPassage8\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system, and reproduction. Vitamin A also helps the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs work properly. \n\nPassage9\nThere are several forms of Vitamin A that are needed by the body. These include: 1  Retinal-a metabolite of vitamin A required for vision. 2  Rentinol-the form of vitamin A that can be stored by the body and converted to retinal when needed. 3  Retinioc acid-a growth factor needed primarily to regulate genes.

A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable. Linear equations can have one or more variables. Linear equations occur abundantly in most subareas of mathematics and especially in applied mathematic\n\nPassage3\nBest Answer: a linear graph is a mathematical illustration of identities with just a line either in its reverse or original form, when it is in its reverse it is a negative linear basically it is always a straight line graph that always has a slope y= mx+c that is the equation hope that helps a bit. Source(s): Report Abuse. A liner graph is a graph that explains a liner relationship. A linear relationship is a relationship in which the amount goes up or down in the same incriment each time, or stays the same, So a linear graph would have to have a straight line, usually diagonal, going through the various points.\n\nPassage4\nA linear line is just a straight line. To graph it, you can use this equation: y=mx+b where m = the slope of the line, and b = the y-intercept of the line, in other words, \u2026 where the line crosses the y-axis. 6 people found this useful. The set of all such ordered pairs defines the graph of y = mx + c, called a learning linear graphing.In the equation y = mx + c, the number m is called the slope of the line and c is known as the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. Sometimes the y-intercept c is 0. In this situation, the equations of the line is y = mx and we say that the line passes through the origin.The basic principle behind drawing a linear graph is that only two points are needed to graph a straight line\n\nPassage5\nThe word linear means in a straight line. If the graph is a line, it is linear. Also, linear equations are of the first order; they contain a variable but not a square (or hig \u2026 her power) of a variable. If the equation contains x2 it is not linear. The set of all such ordered pairs defines the graph of y = mx + c, called a learning linear graphing.In the equation y = mx + c, the number m is called the slope of the line and c is known as the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. Sometimes the y-intercept c is 0. In this situation, the equations of the line is y = mx and we say that the line passes through the origin.The basic principle behind drawing a linear graph is that only two points are needed to graph a straight line\n\nPassage6\nNon-linear graphs are everything else. The straight lines are in the form of y=mx+b. The first non-linear graph we have is a parabola which is the shape of the graph when either x or y is squared. A parabola looks like a U, but the ends are not parallel. If you graph y=x^2 (the most basic one), you'll see a parabola. The next non-linear graph is where either x or y is cubed\n\nPassage7\nExamples Example 1: Draw the graph of the linear equation y = 2x +3 Example 2: Sketch the linear equation y = 2x +3, using the x-and y-intercepts.

In a linear equation in x and y, x is called x is the independent variable and y depends on it. We call y the dependent variable. If the variables have other names, yet do have a dependent relationship, the independent variable is plotted along the horizontal axis. Most linear equations are functions (that is, for every value of x, there is only one corresponding value of y). When you assign a value to the independent variable, x, you can compute the value of the dependent variable, y.

The two main actions of oxytocin in the body are contraction of the womb (uterus) during childbirth and lactation.\n\nPassage6\nIn negative feedback loops, when the brain receives information about a change or deviation in the body's internal conditions, it sends out signals along nerves. These signals prompt the changes in function that correct the deviation and bring the internal conditions back to the normal range [1]. 147 progesterone receptors participate in the estradiol positive feedback mechanism, and thus regulating the LH surge onset [12].

In the negative feedback system, an endocrine gland or controlling system is sensitive to the concentration of substances it regulates or of a product it controls. When the concentration increases to a certain level, the gland is inhibited (a negative effect), and its activity decreases.\n\nPassage10\nOxytocin is controlled by a positive feedback mechanism where release of the hormone causes an action which stimulates more of its own release. When contraction of the uterus starts, for example, oxytocin is released which stimulates more contractions and more oxytocin to be released. In this way, contractions increase in intensity and frequency. There is also a positive feedback involved in the milk-ejection reflex.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to a non-traumatic cause, and may be primary (meaning it occurs in the absence of some underlying lung disease) or secondary (meaning it is associated with some type of underlying lung disease).\n\nPassage4\nentry of air into the pleural cavity in sufficient quantity to cause collapse of the lung and consequent respiratory embarrassment. If it is unilateral there is a mediastinal shift with displacement of the heart to the other side of the chest. Breath sounds are absent from the affected side. Pneumothorax. A small pneumothorax may resolve on its own, but most require medical treatment. The object of treatment is to remove air from the chest and allow the lung to re-expand. This is done by inserting a needle and syringe (if the pneumothorax is small) or chest tube through the chest wall.\n\nPassage5\nTension pneumothorax is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that may be caused by traumatic injury, chronic lung disease, or as a complication of a medical procedure. In this type of pneumothorax, air enters the chest cavity, but cannot escape. A small pneumothorax may resolve on its own, but most require medical treatment. The object of treatment is to remove air from the chest and allow the lung to re-expand. This is done by inserting a needle and syringe (if the pneumothorax is small) or chest tube through the chest wall.\n\nPassage6\n1 A collapsed lung or pneumothorax refers to a condition in which the space between the wall of the chest cavity and the lung itself fills with air, causing all or a portion of the lung to collapse. 1 This result is called a pneumothorax, which is the medical term for a collapsed lung. 2  There are two types of pneumothorax, tension and simple. 3  Causes of collapsed lung include. 4  trauma to the chest cavity (fractured rib, penetrating trauma from a bullet, knife, or other sharp object),\n\nPassage7\nA collapsed lung (pneumothorax) is a buildup of air in the space between the lung and the chest wall (pleural space). As the amount of air in this space increases, the pressure against the lung causes the lung to collapse. This prevents your lung from expanding properly when you try to breathe in, causing shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nPassage8\nEtymology: Gk, pneuma, air, thorax, chest. the presence of air or gas in the pleural space, causing a lung to collapse. Pneumothorax may be the result of an open chest wound that permits the entrance of air, the rupture of an emphysematous vesicle on the surface of the lung, or a severe bout of coughing. A small pneumothorax may resolve on its own, but most require medical treatment. The object of treatment is to remove air from the chest and allow the lung to re-expand. This is done by inserting a needle and syringe (if the pneumothorax is small) or chest tube through the chest wall.\n\nPassage9\n2. Pneumothorax indicates the presence of air in the pleural cavity, usually caused by direct injury to the chest causing air leakage. 3. Atelectasis is considered as a lung collapse, wherein alveoli deflate and lose their air due to loss of elasticity or airway blockage. A pneumothorax is a respiratory condition which literally means abnormal air in the chest cavity outside the lungs. It sometimes occurs as a complication of another chronic respiratory problem.\n\nand the query - pneumo is a prefix meaning air.

Many interconnected hyphae form a mycelium, which\u2014when visible to the naked eye (macroscopic)\u2014is commonly called mold (or, in botanical terminology, thallus). During sexual reproduction, many Ascomycota typically produce large numbers of asci. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences.\n\nPassage2\nZygomycota, or zygote fungi, is a phylum of fungi. The name comes from zygosporangia, where resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction. Approximately 1050 species are known. They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. \n\nPassage3\nLike basidiomycota, most ascomycota sprout from spores into hapliod mycelia. These mycelia can produce two types of reproductive structures. First, they can produce conidiophores for asexual reproduction. Conidiaphores may simply branch off from the mycelia or they may be formed in fruiting bodies. There are 2000 identified genera and 30,000 species of Ascomycota. The unifying characteristic among these diverse groups is the presence of a reproductive structure known as the ascus, though in some cases it has a reduced role in the life cycle.\n\nPassage4\nAll members of the Ascomycota produce an ascus that contains ascospores. The class includes the largest group and most successful of all fungi, with over 44,000 known species. The group has existed for many millions of years and there is some evidence that they took their origin from Zygomycotous forms. \n\nPassage5\nAscomycetes are 'spore shooters'. They are fungi which produce microscopic spores inside special, elongated cells or sacs, known as 'asci', which give the group its name. As the spores mature within an ascus, increasing fluid pressure builds up inside until eventually the top bursts off, rapidly releasing the spores. \n\nPassage6\nTypes of Fungi. The 100,000 identified species of organisms commonly classed together as fungi are customarily divided into four phyla, or divisions: Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Deuteromycota. Ascomycota includes yeasts, the powdery mildews, the black and blue-green molds, edible types such as the morel and the truffle, and species that cause such diseases of plants as Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight, apple scab, and ergot. There are over 50,000 species, about 25,000 of which occur only in lichens\n\nPassage7\nAscomycota. Ascomycota are the sac fungi group, named for the cases (often sac-shaped) where they produce their spores. The group includes such fungi as yeasts, truffles, morels. There are 32,000 known living species of ascomycota fungi, comprising the biggest phylum of fungi. Ascomycota account for 75% of all described fungi. As with all true fungi, ascomycota can reproduce by both sexual and asexual means, the latter being more common for the development of the mycelium. Ascomycota produce ascospores form inside ascus (sac, asci for plural) and release them into the air, water, or onto other organisms for dispersal when they are disturbed.\n\nPassage8\nMany species of Ascomycota also (or exclusively) produce spores through an asexual or mitotic process; these spores, called conidia, exhibit a wide range of size, shape, color and septation among the different fungi in which they are formed. No one knows for sure how many species of fungi there are on our planet at this point in time, but what is known is that at least 99,000 species of fungi have been described, and new species are described at the rate of approximately 1200 per year (Blackwell 2011; Kirk et al.\n\nPassage9\nAscomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya.

The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second. The third level observatory's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground, the highest accessible to the public in the European Union.\n\nPassage6\nA Bit of History The Eiffel Tower was built for the International Exhibition of Paris of 1889 commemorating the centenary of the French Revolution. The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII of England, opened the tower. Of the 700 proposals submitted in a design competition, Gustave Eiffel's was unanimously chosen. Over 100 designs were submitted, and the World's Fair Committee selected the conception of a 984 foot (300 meter) open-lattice wrought iron tower. This design was the creation of Alexendre-Gustave Eiffel. He was a renown French civil engineer who specialized in metal construction.\n\nPassage7\nEiffel TowerBut, he is especially known for the Eiffel Tower built between 1887 and 1889 for the Universal Exposition of 1889 in Paris.

In 1882, Eiffel began work on the Garabit viaduct, which was at the time the highest bridge in the world.\n\nPassage9\nFor forty years it was the tallest man-made structure in the world. The Eiffel Tower was the entrance arch to the Worlds Fair and it was one of a number of designs entered as part of a competition. Alexandre Gustave Eiffel's company won the competition and so the the Tower became known as the Eiffel Tower. It was named after Alexandre Eiffel whose team of engineers designed it. It cost 260,000 to build in 1889 with most of the money being provided by Eiffel himself and the French state. The Eiffel Tower rises to a height of 985 feet and for over forty years it was the highest\n\nPassage10\nSynopsis.

In such cases a grandparentage test or an avuncular DNA test can substitute a paternity DNA test. Siblings may also do a sibling DNA test, which will establish the extent of the sibling relationship: half siblings, full siblings or not siblings. The below are the relationship DNA tests we offer.\n\nPassage4\nDNA paternity testing is the use of DNA profiling (known as genetic fingerprinting) to determine whether two individuals are biologically parent and child. In a DNA parentage test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage) is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child.\n\nPassage5\nI.a.

DNA Relatives finds matches by comparing your DNA with other 23andMe members. When two people share identical segments of DNA, this indicates that they share a recent common ancestor. The length and number of these identical segments is used to predict the relationship between relatives. In general, for the same percent DNA shared, longer segments give a closer predicted relationship than a greater number of shorter segments. The estimate is based off a number of assumptions about population growth and characteristics of specific populations.\n\nPassage7\nGenetic genealogy involves the use of genealogical DNA testing to determine the level and type of the genetic relationship between individuals. This application of genetics became popular with family historians in the first decade of the 21st century, as tests became affordable. \n\nPassage8\nThey reasoned that since DNA determines the structure of proteins, two organisms closely related by evolution ought to have similar protein structures. They might, for instance, explore a relationship between humans and chimpanzees by introducing proteins from each into a rabbit. Scientists can also sequence huge chunks of genetic information, and then compare them to one another. When they do this, they look for strands of DNA -- or RNA or proteins -- that exhibit homologous sequences, or sequences with similar genes on them.\n\nPassage9\nDNA relationship testing can assist to determine whether biological links between relatives really exist. This type of test can be performed between various degrees of relationships including siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles.

The fundamental parts of the nation state are the nation and the state. Let's start with the state. In the broadest of terms, the state is a body of government. All the rules and laws, the government officials and their titles, the physical boundaries and those who define them-these make up the state. The nation state is a system of organization defined by geography, politics, and culture. The nation is cultural identity that is shared by the people, and the state is the governing administration.

The terms nation, state, country and nation-state are used to refer to political, economic, social and cultural actors in the international system. The modern nation-state refers to a single or multiple nationalities joined together in a formal political union. A nation-state differs from a state or a nation for a couple of important reasons: A nation refers only to a socio-cultural entity, a union of people sharing who can identify culturally and linguistically. This concept does not necessarily consider formal political unions.\n\nPassage4\nThe nation state is a certain form of state that has a territory where mainly one nation lives. The state is a political entity (the government, etc.); the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. The term nation state means that the two are on the same territory, and this distinguishes the nation state from the other types of state, which existed before.\n\nPassage5\nThe most noticeable characteristic is the degree to which nation states use the state as an instrument of national unity, in economic, social and cultural life.

Health Issues and Roof Mold. Roof stains, roof mold, mildew, fungus, algae, lichens, fungi, and moss can cause health problems. Roof stains are serious business. Roof cleaning can remove dangerous roof mold.\n\nPassage2\nMoss's Effects. Moss itself is harmless. It does not produce any dangerous spores or fumes, it contains no poisons or irritants and it lacks the mass to physically damage any structures, including roof shingles. If a mold colony grows on your roof, the fungus can cause permanent damage. You can only ensure a mold-free roof by keeping the shingles free from excess moisture, and you can only free your roof of excess moisture by eliminating moisture-trapping organisms like moss.\n\nPassage3\nMold, mildew, moss and algae spores exist in the air, but they won\u2019t start growing on your roof if the right living environment isn\u2019t there. The best way to spot and treat roof mold and mildew and roof moss and algae problems before they grow out of control is through biannual roof inspections. As the moss grows, it contains even more moisture, all resting on the surface of your roof. Eventually, your roofing materials begin to rot, compromising the integrity of your roof. Mold: Appearing as fuzzy black, brown, or green spots or slimy film, mold is attracted to damp or humid environments and spreads quickly.\n\nPassage4\nHaving mold, mildew, moss, or algae growing on your roof is more than just an unsightly nuisance that brings down the value of your property.

Mold: Appearing as fuzzy black, brown, or green spots or slimy film, mold is attracted to damp or humid environments and spreads quickly.\n\nPassage5\nMold. Mold spores reproduce and grow favorably in atmospheres that are excessive in moisture and that have little airflow. The spore will reproduce rapidly on the peat moss. Mold will eat away at the moss as it grows and release chemicals that will make the moss completely unsuitable for the future growth of plants. Mold is a dangerous fungus that can cause serious health risks to humans, plants and animals. \n\nPassage6\nDuring the moist, cooler months, these spores grow into moss. In drier weather, the moss goes dormant, turning into a rust-colored plant mass. Moss is different from algae, lichen or mold fungi, which are typically easier to clean and less damaging to a roof. Moss readily grows on roof shingles, especially in the spaces between shingles where the spores collect. In wet climates, moss commonly grows into a mat that can be as much as a few inches thick. \n\nPassage7\nMost of us know that moss likes to grow in humid, cloudy conditions. The best way to protect your paved surfaces from moss growth is to prevent moss spores from growing in first place. Spores settle in cracks and holes where soil and water collect. Regularly sweeping your driveway, roof or walkway will help prevent spores from settling on the surface. \n\nPassage8\nFalse \u2013 Moss spores may be as common as mold spores or pollen at times, but they are generally non-allergenic. You can be allergic to anything, but the likelihood that moss or it\u2019s spores will give you allergies, is extremely low. False \u2013 Moss spores are everywhere, even if there aren\u2019t any mosses on your property. The spores travel on the wind to extreme distances, therefore proximity doesn\u2019t mean density.
